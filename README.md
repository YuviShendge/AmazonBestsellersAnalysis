# Amazon Bestsellers Analysis

This analysis was my final project for my Programming with R class.

This topic was chosen due to my love for books and my desire to learn more about book demographics and targeting.

In the analysis I :

-Identify trends in book genres over time.

-Analyze relationships between pricing, ratings, and reviews.

-Use clustering techniques to categorize books by popularity and pricing.
